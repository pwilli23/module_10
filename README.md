# Crypto Investments Clustering

* In this Project, we will be taking a look at 2 different clustering methods: the Standard Method Vs the PCA Method

## The Standard Method:

1. We first used the `fit_transform` function to scale the market data 

2. Created a Scaled market DataFrame: used the `index` and `set_index` functions to set our cryptocurrency coin ID as the first column

3. After scaling our data, we created a list of k-values to try from 1-11 by using the `list(range())` function. Then created an empty list called inertia and used a loop to compute the inertia for each possible value of k from 1-11

5. Created a dictionary called `elbow_data` to plot our elbow curve

6. Used `hvplot.line` function to create our elbow curve and chose the best value of k at 4 and initialized our Clustering model with the amount of `n_clusters=4` and fit the K-Means model with the scaled market data 

7. Used the `.predict` fucntion to predict the clusters to group the cryptocurrencies and added a column named StockCluster to store this data

8. Now we are ready to create our Scatterplot: We set X equal to price change percentage 24 hour and Y equal to price change percentage 7 day, and grouped the data by StockCluster into 4 distinct groups

## The PCA Method:

1. Created a PCA variable and set it equal to `n_components=3` then used the `pca.fit_transform` function to reduce the scaled data to 3 components

2. Then found the `explained_variance_ratio_ to see how much of the data is conveyed in the 3 components
